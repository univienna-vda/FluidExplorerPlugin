# Fluid Explorer Plugin

Fluid Explorer is an Autodesk Maya plugin developed for visual effects design based on a result-driven parameter space exploration.

Commonly, graphic artists employ physically-based simulations for the generation of visual effects such as fire, explosions, smoke or related phenomena. 
Animation software packages usually provide dynamic simulators in order to create such visual effects. However, the task of finding the correct parameters 
of the desired simulation is difficult and time-consuming, which often results in a cumbersome trial-and-error approach.

Therefore, in order to overcome that 
issue, Fluid Explorer supports artists in finding the correct fluid parameters of a particular vision. Based on a three-dimensional scene description, parameter 
space sampling and spatial-temporal clustering techniques are applied in order to generate a concise overview of the achievable variations. A visualization system 
allows artists to explorer the simulation space in a goal-oriented way. Visualization and rendering techniques are applied in order to provide instant visual feedback.
